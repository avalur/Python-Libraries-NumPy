In order to transform your image into a NumPy array that can be manipulated, you can use the 
`imread` function from the `matplotlib.pyplot` submodule. 

For more information on how images are treated when converted to NumPy arrays, 
see [A crash course on NumPy for images](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/user_guide/numpy_images.html) from the `scikit-image` documentation.
